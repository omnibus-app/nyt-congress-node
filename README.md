=================

Node wrapper for NYT Congress API (bills only, for now)

[API Docs](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/congress_api)

Plan to add methods for all endpoints; currently only supports endpoints listed under Bills.

## TODO

### Endpoints
[ ] Add Members endpoints
[ ] Add Votes endpoints
[ ] Add Nominees endpoints
[ ] Add Other endpoints

### Misc
[ ] validate params against params.js
[ ] Default to current congress if none specified
